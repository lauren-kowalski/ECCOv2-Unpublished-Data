# ECCOv2-Unpublished-Data
Codes to visualize ECCOv2 unpublished data. This data has a different interface than the formally published datasets.

I developed code to visualize unpublished runs of the ECCOLLC1080_REG_AMS as well as to correlate the time step of the model to actual an month and year. These data are modeled for the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Sea in Antarctica.

The model starts in 1992.

Review Nakayama_et_al_2014 & Nakayama_et_al_2018 for model information.
